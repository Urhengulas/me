## about

Reacting to the "Artic Code Vault", by the [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/), which aims to preserve active public GitHub-repositories in a way to exist for more than 1000 years, I started thinking what I want to be kept  for the future. <br>
Out of an egoistic feeling, I decided to create this repository, to store various information related to my person.

It may also serve for people interested in me. Be it friends, potential business partners or just curious human beings.
