# Google Summer of Code 2020 - First month

I am very happy to be part of the GSoC 2020 at Mozilla to support [`rav1e`](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e) "The fastest and safest AV1 encoder".

## rav1e
The most important thing first: The name is an abbreviation for "rust AV1 encoder".

As the name suggests `rav1e` is a video encoder for the [AV1 video coding format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1), written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### video encoder
Simplified spoken a video encoder takes uncompressed video as an input, compresses it and outputs a way tinier video. This output is way handier than the input and can be e.g. saved to disk or distributed over the network. Later it can be decompressed using a video decoder (e.g. [`dav1d`](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d)) to get back to the original video quality.

Under the hood it is very complex from a mathematical and software engineering-perspective, but to be honest I don't fully get it yet.

### AV1
> AOMedia Video 1 [...] is an open, royalty-free video coding format designed for video transmissions over the Internet. It was developed [...] by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), a consortium founded in 2015 that includes semiconductor firms, video on demand providers, video content producers, software development companies and web browser vendors.

### rust
"Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety" [‚ÅΩ¬≤‚Åæ](#citations). It is actually one reason I choose to apply for this project, because I want to learn it properly.

## My project
My goal is to enable and improve [`webassembly (wasm)`](https://webassembly.org/) support of `rav1e`, mainly to make it usable as an in-browser encoder.

### Steps to achieve this
1. build a JavaScript/TypeScript API for `rav1e` _(well documented and tested, of course üòâ)_
2. provide demo applications _(for external developers)_
3. profile wasm target (size and time)
4. improve wasm target based on profiling

## My journey (so far)
Before starting to work on my actual project, I familiarized myself with the codebase, community and the overall domain of video processing. To do so I took on some small issues ([`#2328`](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/pull/2328), [`#2344`](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/pull/2344))
