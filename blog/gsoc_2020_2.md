# Google Summer of Code 2020 - Second month

In my previous post about [my first month]() of the Google Summer of Code 2020 at Mozilla I told about my first steps of enabling `rav1e` in the browser using webassembly.

This time we are actually encoding a video! ðŸ˜²

## Jsapi v0.2
([`#2446`](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/pull/2446))

1. Collect
2. Construct
3. Encode

### dcv
([`aws/dcv-color-primitives#35`](https://github.com/aws/dcv-color-primitives/issues/35))

For the data transformation I was on the lookout for a convenient library to get my data from RGBA to YCbCr. `dcv-color-primitives` ([`crates.io`](https://crates.io/crates/dcv-color-primitives)) is my choice, because it
1. aims to be "[a]ware of the underlying hardware and supplemental cpu extension sets"
2. has 0 dependencies ðŸ˜±
3. has good documentation

The only problem was that it didn't support `wasm32` targets. I opened `aws/dcv-color-primitives#35` to ask about this and quickly got an answer by [`fabiosky`](https://github.com/fabiosky). He provided a small workaround and after a couple of weeks the webassembly support was introduced by `https://github.com/aws/dcv-color-primitives/pull/36` and got shipped in `v0.1.14`.

### wasm-opt issue
([`rustwasm/wasm-pack#886`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/886), [`#2479`](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/pull/2479))

Quite randomly `wasm-pack` stopped working, puking a immense error message at me, saying sth about invalid input for `wasm-opt`. Obviously I tried to figure what I did wrong this time, but it failed even on master (jsapi v0.1 at this time) which was defenitely working before and also in the CI. So I thought there is a slight chance it's actually not my fault and so I opened `rustwasm/wasm-pack#886`. Quickly some more people with the same issue were found and another issue [`WebAssembly/binaryen#3006`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/issues/3006) dealing with the same issue popped up.

After some back and forth it turned out that the generated `.wasm` uses some non-MVP feature, [`mutable-global`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/mutable-global/blob/master/proposals/mutable-global/Overview.md)) in particular.


## prevent passing frames
([`#2460`](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/issues/2460))

I opened `#2460` to figure out the problem with feeding the pixel data into the frame. Though the issue was a misconfiguration on my side, it also revealed that the `rav1e::api::Context<T>` doesn't validate the dimensions of the input frame (see [`#2461`](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/issues/2461)).
